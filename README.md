# Kitchen Chaos - Godot Version

## Introduction
This game is the recreation of Code Monkey's Kitchen Chaos Unity tutorial in Godot 4.2. I created this project to make myself familiar with the engine. I tried to implement everything in Godot as closely as possible to how it was made in Unity; however, it was necessary to deviate from the original from time to time, mostly in the UI and because GDScript does not support interfaces.
